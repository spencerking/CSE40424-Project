								<p>The opening afternoon class for Mary Walden's ego-shift was almost
								over, and Mary was practically certain the teacher would not call on
								her to recite her assignment, when Carl Blair got it into his mind to
								try to pass her a dirty note. Mary knew it would be a screamingly
								funny Ego-Shifting Room limerick and was about to reach for the note
								when Mrs. Harris's voice crackled through the room.</p>

								<p>"Carl Blair! I believe you have an important message. Surely you will
								want the whole class to hear it. Come forward, please."</p>

								<p>As he made his way before the class, the boy's blush-covered freckles
								reappeared against his growing pallor. Haltingly and in an agonized
								monotone, he recited from the note:</p>
								<div class="stanza">
									<div class="verse">"There was a young hyper named Phil,</div>
									<div class="verse">Who kept a third head for a thrill.</div>
									<div class="verse">Said he, 'It's all right,</div>
									<div class="verse">I enjoy my plight.</div>
									<div class="verse">I shift my third out when it's chill.'"</div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p2_content">
								<p>The class didn't dare laugh. Their eyes burned down at their laps in
								shame. Mary managed to throw Carl Blair a compassionate glance as he
								returned to his seat, but she instantly regretted ever having been kind
								to him.</p>
								<p>"Mary Walden, you seemed uncommonly interested in reading something
								just now. Perhaps you wouldn't mind reading your assignment to the
								class."</p>
								<p>There it was, and just when the class was almost over. Mary could have
								scratched Carl Blair. She clutched her paper grimly and strode to the
								front.</p>
								<p>"Today's assignment in Pharmacy History is, 'Schizophrenia since the
								Ancient Pre-pharmacy days.'" Mary took enough breath to get into the
								first paragraph.</p>
								<p>"Schizophrenia is where two or more personalities live in the
								same brain. The ancients of the 20th Century actually looked upon
								schizophrenia as a disease! Everyone felt </p>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p3_content">
								<p>it was very shameful to have
								a schizophrenic person in the family, and, since children lived right
								with the same parents who had borne them, it was very bad. If you were
								a schizophrenic child in the 20th Century, you would be locked up
								behind bars and people would call you&mdash;" </p>
								<p>Mary blushed and stumbled over the daring word&mdash;"crazy." "The ancients
								locked up strong ego groups right along with weak ones. Today we would
								lock up those ancient people."</p>
								<p>The class agreed silently.</p>
								<p>"But there were more and more schizophrenics to lock up. By 1950 the
								<i>prisons</i> and hospitals were so full of schizophrenic people that
								the ancients did not have room left to lock up any more. They were
								beginning to see that soon everyone would be schizophrenic.</p>
								<p>"Of course, in the 20th Century, the schizophrenic people were almost
								as helpless</p>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p4_content">
								<p>and 'crazy' as the ancient Modern men. Naturally they did
								not fight wars and lead the silly life of the Moderns, but without
								proper drugs they couldn't control their Ego-shiftability. The
								personalities in a brain would always be fighting each other. One
								personality would cut the body or hurt it or make it filthy, so that
								when the other personality took over the body, it would have to suffer.
								No, the schizophrenic people of the 20th Century were almost as 'crazy'
								as the ancient Moderns.</p>
								<p>"But then the drugs were invented one by one and the schizophrenic
								people of the 20th Century were freed of their troubles. With the
								drugs the personalities of each body were able to live side by side in
								harmony at last. It turned out that many schizophrenic people, called
								overendowed personalities, simply had so many talents and viewpoints
								that it took two or more personalities to handle everything.</p>
								<p>"The drugs worked so well that the ancients had to let millions of
								schizophrenic people out </p>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p5_content">
								<p> from behind the bars of 'crazy' houses. That
								was the Great Emancipation of the 1990s. From then on, schizophrenic
								people had trouble only when they criminally didn't take their drugs.
								Usually, there are two egos in a schizophrenic person&mdash;the hyperalter,
								or prime ego, and the hypoalter, the alternate ego. There often were
								more than two, but the Medicorps makes us take our drugs so that won't
								happen to us.</p>
								<p>"At last someone realized that if everyone took the new drugs, the
								great wars would stop. At the World Congress of 1997, laws were passed
								to make everyone take the drugs. There were many fights over this
								because some people wanted to stay Modern and fight wars. The Medicorps
								was organized and told to kill anyone who wouldn't take their drugs as
								prescribed. Now the laws are enforced and everybody takes the drugs and
								the hyperalter and hypoalter are each allowed to have the body for an
								ego-shift of five days...."</p>

								<p>Mary Walden faltered. She looked up at the faces of her classmates,
								started to turn to Mrs. Harris and felt the sickness growing in her
								head. Six great waves of crescendo silence washed through her. The
								silence swept away everything but the terror, which stood in her frail
								body like a shrieking rock.</p>
