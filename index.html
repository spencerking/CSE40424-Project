								<p>The opening afternoon class for Mary Walden's ego-shift was almost
								over, and Mary was practically certain the teacher would not call on
								her to recite her assignment, when Carl Blair got it into his mind to
								try to pass her a dirty note. Mary knew it would be a screamingly
								funny Ego-Shifting Room limerick and was about to reach for the note
								when Mrs. Harris's voice crackled through the room.</p>

								<p>"Carl Blair! I believe you have an important message. Surely you will
								want the whole class to hear it. Come forward, please."</p>

								<p>As he made his way before the class, the boy's blush-covered freckles
								reappeared against his growing pallor. Haltingly and in an agonized
								monotone, he recited from the note:</p>
								<div class="stanza">
									<div class="verse">"There was a young hyper named Phil,</div>
									<div class="verse">Who kept a third head for a thrill.</div>
									<div class="verse">Said he, 'It's all right,</div>
									<div class="verse">I enjoy my plight.</div>
									<div class="verse">I shift my third out when it's chill.'"</div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p2_content">
								<p>The class didn't dare laugh. Their eyes burned down at their laps in
								shame. Mary managed to throw Carl Blair a compassionate glance as he
								returned to his seat, but she instantly regretted ever having been kind
								to him.</p>
								<p>"Mary Walden, you seemed uncommonly interested in reading something
								just now. Perhaps you wouldn't mind reading your assignment to the
								class."</p>
								<p>There it was, and just when the class was almost over. Mary could have
								scratched Carl Blair. She clutched her paper grimly and strode to the
								front.</p>
								<p>"Today's assignment in Pharmacy History is, 'Schizophrenia since the
								Ancient Pre-pharmacy days.'" Mary took enough breath to get into the
								first paragraph.</p>
								<p>"Schizophrenia is where two or more personalities live in the
								same brain. The ancients of the 20th Century actually looked upon
								schizophrenia as a disease! Everyone felt</p>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p3_content">
								<p>  it was very shameful to have
								a schizophrenic person in the family, and, since children lived right
								with the same parents who had borne them, it was very bad. If you were
								a schizophrenic child in the 20th Century, you would be locked up
								behind bars and people would call you&mdash;" </p>
								<p>Mary blushed and stumbled over the daring word&mdash;"crazy." "The ancients
								locked up strong ego groups right along with weak ones. Today we would
								lock up those ancient people."</p>
								<p>The class agreed silently.</p>
								<p>"But there were more and more schizophrenics to lock up. By 1950 the
								<i>prisons</i> and hospitals were so full of schizophrenic people that
								the ancients did not have room left to lock up any more. They were
								beginning to see that soon everyone would be schizophrenic.</p>
								<p>"Of course, in the 20th Century, the schizophrenic people were almost
								as helpless</p>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p4_content">
								<p>  and 'crazy' as the ancient Modern men. Naturally they did
								not fight wars and lead the silly life of the Moderns, but without
								proper drugs they couldn't control their Ego-shiftability. The
								personalities in a brain would always be fighting each other. One
								personality would cut the body or hurt it or make it filthy, so that
								when the other personality took over the body, it would have to suffer.
								No, the schizophrenic people of the 20th Century were almost as 'crazy'
								as the ancient Moderns.</p>
								<p>"But then the drugs were invented one by one and the schizophrenic
								people of the 20th Century were freed of their troubles. With the
								drugs the personalities of each body were able to live side by side in
								harmony at last. It turned out that many schizophrenic people, called
								overendowed personalities, simply had so many talents and viewpoints
								that it took two or more personalities to handle everything.</p>
								<p>"The drugs worked so well that the ancients had to let millions of
								schizophrenic people out </p>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p5_content">
								<p>from behind the bars of 'crazy' houses. That
								was the Great Emancipation of the 1990s. From then on, schizophrenic
								people had trouble only when they criminally didn't take their drugs.
								Usually, there are two egos in a schizophrenic person&mdash;the hyperalter,
								or prime ego, and the hypoalter, the alternate ego. There often were
								more than two, but the Medicorps makes us take our drugs so that won't
								happen to us.</p>
								<p>"At last someone realized that if everyone took the new drugs, the
								great wars would stop. At the World Congress of 1997, laws were passed
								to make everyone take the drugs. There were many fights over this
								because some people wanted to stay Modern and fight wars. The Medicorps
								was organized and told to kill anyone who wouldn't take their drugs as
								prescribed. Now the laws are enforced and everybody takes the drugs and
								the hyperalter and hypoalter are each allowed to have the body for an
								ego-shift of five days...."</p>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p6_content">
								<p>Mary Walden faltered. She looked up at the faces of her classmates,
								started to turn to Mrs. Harris and felt the sickness growing in her
								head. Six great waves of crescendo silence washed through her. The
								silence swept away everything but the terror, which stood in her frail
								body like a shrieking rock.</p>
								<p>Mary heard Mrs. Harris hurry to the shining dispensary along one
								wall of the classroom and return to stand before her with a swab of
								antiseptic and a disposable syringe.</p>
								<p>Mrs. Harris helped her to a chair. A few minutes after the expert
								injection, Mary's mind struggled back from its core of silence.</p>
								<p>"Mary, dear, I'm sorry. I haven't been watching you closely enough."</p>
								<p>"Oh, Mrs. Harris...." Mary's chin trembled. "I hope it never happens
								again."</p>
								<p>"Now, child, we all have to go through these things when we're young.
								You're just a little </p>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p7_content">
								<p> slower than the others in acclimatizing to the
								drugs. You'll be fourteen soon and the medicop assures me you'll be
								over this sort of thing just as the others are." </p>
								<p>Mrs. Harris dismissed the class and when they had all filed from the
								room, she turned to Mary.</p>
								<p>"I think, dear, we should visit the clinic together, don't you?"</p>
								<p>"Yes, Mrs. Harris." Mary was not frightened now. She was just ashamed
								to be such a difficult child and so slow to acclimatize to the drugs.</p>
								<p>As she and the teacher walked down the long corridor to the clinic,
								Mary made up her mind to tell the medicop what she thought was wrong.
								It was not herself. It was her hypoalter, that nasty little Susan
								Shorrs. Sometimes, when Susan had the body, the things Susan was doing
								and thinking came to Mary like what the ancients had called <i>dreams</i>,
								and Mary had </p>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p8_content">
								<p> never liked this secondary ego whom she could never really
								know.</p>
								<p>Mrs. Harris waited while Mary went into the clinic.</p>
								<p>Mary was glad to find Captain Thiel, the nice medicop, on duty. But she
								was silent while the X-rays were being taken, and, of course, while he
								got the blood samples, she concentrated on being brave.</p>
								<p>Later, while Captain Thiel looked in her eyes with the bright little
								light, Mary said calmly, "Do you know my hypoalter, Susan Shorrs?"</p>
								<p>The medicop drew back and made some notes on a pad before answering.
								"Why, yes. She's in here quite often too."</p>
								<p>"Does she look like me?"</p>
								<p>"Not much. She's a very nice little girl...." He hesitated, visibly
								fumbling.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p9_content">
								<p>Mary blurted, "Tell me truly, what's she like?"</p>
								<p>Captain Thiel gave her his nice smile. "Well, I'll tell you a secret if
								you keep it to yourself."</p>
								<p>"Oh, I promise."</p>
								<p>He leaned over and whispered in her ear and she liked the clean odor of
								him. "She's not nearly as pretty as you are."</p>
								<p>Mary wanted very badly to put her arms around him and hug him. Instead,
								wondering if Mrs. Harris, waiting outside, had heard, she drew back
								self-consciously and said, "Susan is the cause of all this trouble, the
								nasty little thing."</p>
								<p>"Oh now!" the medicop exclaimed. "I don't think so, Mary. She's in
								trouble, too, you know."</p>
								<p>"She still eats sauerkraut." Mary was defiant.</p>
								<p>"But what's wrong with that?"</p>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p10_content">
								<p>"You told her not to last year because it makes me sick on my shift.
								But it agrees in buckets with a little pig like her."</p>
								<p>The medicop took this seriously. He made a note on the pad. "Mary, you
								should have complained sooner."</p>
								<p>"Do you think my father might not like me because Susan Shorrs is my
								hypoalter?" she asked abruptly.</p>
								<p>"I hardly think so, Mary. After all, he doesn't even know her. He's
								never on her Ego shift."</p>
								<p>"A little bit," Mary said, and was immediately frightened.</p>
								<p>Captain Thiel glanced at her sharply. "What do you mean by that, child?"</p>
								<p>"Oh, nothing," Mary said hastily. "I just thought maybe he was."</p>
								<p>"Let me see your pharmacase," he said rather </p>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p11_content">
								<p>severely.</p>
								<p>Mary slipped the pharmacase off the belt at her waist and handed it
								to him. Captain Thiel extracted the prescription card from the back
								and threw it away. He slipped a new card in the taping machine on his
								desk and punched out a new prescription, which he reinserted in the
								pharmacase. In the space on the front, he wrote directions for Mary to
								take the drugs numbered from left to right.</p>
								<p>Mary watched his serious face and remembered that he had complimented
								her about being prettier than Susan. "Captain Thiel, is your hypoalter
								as handsome as you are?"</p>
								<p>The young medicop emptied the remains of the old prescription from the
								pharmacase and took it to the dispensary in the corner, where he slid
								it into the filling slot. He seemed unmoved by her question and simply
								muttered, "Much handsomer."</p>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p12_content">
								<p>The machine automatically filled the case from the punched card on its
								back and he returned it to Mary. "Are you taking your drugs exactly as
								prescribed? You know there are very strict laws about that, and as soon
								as you are fourteen, you will be held to them."</p>
								<p>Mary nodded solemnly. Great straitjackets, who didn't know there were
								laws about taking your drugs?</p>
								<p>There was a long pause and Mary knew she was supposed to leave. She
								wanted, though, to stay with Captain Thiel and talk with him. She
								wondered how it would be if he were appointed her father.</p>
								<p>Mary was not hurt that her shy compliment to him had gone unnoticed.
								She had only wanted something to talk about. Finally she said
								desperately, "Captain Thiel, how is it possible for a body to change as
								much from one Ego shift to another as it does between Susan and me?"</p>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p13_content">
								<p>"There isn't all the change you imagine," he said. "Have you had your
								first physiology?"</p>
								<p>"Yes. I was very good...." Mary saw from his smile that her inadvertent
								little conceit had trapped her.</p>
								<p>"Then, Miss Mary Walden, how do <i>you</i> think it is possible?"</p>
								<p>Why did teachers and medicops have to be this way? When all you wanted
								was to have them talk to you, they turned everything around and made
								you think.</p>
								<p>She quoted unhappily from her schoolbook, "The main things in an
								ego shift are the two vegetative nervous systems that translate the
								conditions of either personality to the blood and other organs right
								from the brain. The vegetative nervous systems change the rate at which
								the liver burns or stores sugar and the rate at which the kidneys
								excrete...."</p>
								<p>Through the closed door to the other room, </p>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p14_content">
								<p>  Mrs. Harris's voice raised
								at the visiophone said distinctly, "<i>But, Mr. Walden....</i>"</p>
								<p>"Reabsorb," corrected Captain Thiel.</p>
								<p>"What?" She didn't know what to listen to&mdash;the medicop or the distant
								voice of Mrs. Harris.</p>
								<p>"It's better to think of the kidneys as reabsorbing salts and nutrients
								from the filtrated blood."</p>
								<p>"Oh."</p>
								<p>"<i>But, Mr. Walden, we can overdo a good thing. The proper amount of
								neglect is definitely required for full development of some personality
								types and Mary certainly is one of those....</i>"</p>
								<p>"What about the pituitary gland that's attached to the brain and
								controls all the other glands during the shift of egos?" pressed
								Captain Thiel distractingly.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p15_content">
								<p>"<i>But, Mr. Walden, too much neglect at this critical point may cause
								another personality to split off and we can't have that. Adequate
								personalities are congenital. A new one now would only rob the present
								personalities. You are the appointed parent of this child and the Board
								of Education will enforce your compliance with our diagnosis....</i>"</p>
								<p>Mary's mind leaped to a page in one of her childhood storybooks. It
								was an illustration of a little girl resting beneath a great tree that
								overhung a brook. There were friendly little wild animals about. Mary
								could see the page clearly and she thought about it very hard instead
								of crying.</p>
								<p>"Aren't you interested any more, Mary?" Captain Thiel was looking at
								her strangely.</p>
								<p>The agitation in her voice was a surprise. "I have to get home. I have
								a lot of things to do."</p>
								<p>Outside, when Mrs. Harris seemed suddenly to </p>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p16_content">
								<p> realize that something was
								wrong, and delicately probed to find out whether her angry voice had
								been overheard, Mary said calmly and as if it didn't matter, "Was my
								father home when you called him before?"</p>
								<p>"Why&mdash;yes, Mary. But you mustn't pay any attention to conversations
								like that, darling."</p>
								<p><i>You can't force him to like me</i>, she thought to herself, and she was
								angry with Mrs. Harris because now her father would only dislike her
								more.</p>
								<p>Neither her father nor her mother was home when Mary walked into the
								evening-darkened apartment. It was the first day of the family shift,
								and on that day, for many periods now, they had not been home until
								late.</p>
								<p>Mary walked through the empty rooms, turning on lights. She passed
								up the electrically heated dinner her father had set out for her.
								Presently she found herself at the storage room door. She opened it
								slowly.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="p_content" id="p17_content">
								<p>After hesitating a while she went in and began an exhausting search for
								the old storybook with the picture in it.</p>
								<p>Finally she knew she could not find it. She stood in the middle of the
								junk-filled room and began to cry.</p>
